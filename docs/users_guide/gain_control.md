# Gain Control

The Gain Control panel on the toolbar has two sliders to control the RF and AF gain:

The **RF Gain** slider is enabled only if the **Single Gain** setting is set to **true** in
[SDR settings](setting_up_sdr.md).

To adjust the gain, click on the slider, or spin the mouse wheel over it, or drag the thumb control.
