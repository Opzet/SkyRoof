The Satellite Details panel shows information about the currently selected satellite:

This panel displays the same information as the upper portion of the
[Satellite Details window](satellite_details_window.md). The difference is that, unlike the window,
the panel may be docked anywhere in the user interface.

See the
[Satellite Data](satellite_data.md) section for information about available data.
