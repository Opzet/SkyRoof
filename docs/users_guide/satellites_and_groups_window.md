## Exploring the satellite data

This window is a great tool for browsing the information about the satellites that is available in SkyRoof.
For a detailed description of the data see the [Satellite Data](satellite_data.md) section.

### Highlighting

The satellites are highlighted based on their properties as described in the
[Satellite Highlighting](satellite_highlighting.md) section.

### Filtering

Using the checkboxes at the top of the left panel, the satellites may be filtered by:

- **Status** - Alive, Future or Re-Entered. If you cannot find some satellite in the list, tick the
    Re-Entered checkbox, maybe this satellite has already re-entered the atmosphere;
- **Bands** - show only the satellites that have at least one transmitter working in the VHF (2m), UHF (70cm) or in any other band;
- **Radio** - the radio type: linear transponder, FM transceiver or a telemetry/beacon transmitter;
- **Service** - Ham or non-Ham, as marked in the database.

### Searching

Use the **Search** box to search the satellites by name, callsign or NORAD Id.
The search is case-insensitive, punctuation is ignored. If a satellite has multiple names, any name may be used.
For example, the RS-44 satellite is found by entering "RS-44", "rs44" or "DOSAAF-85" in the search box.

The numbers on the bottom bar show the total number of satellites in the database and the number of those that match the filters
and search string.

### Viewing Details

Right-click on a satellite and click on **Satellite Details**, or press **Ctrl-D**, to open the
[Satellite Details window](satellite_details_window.md).

### Renaming Satellites
