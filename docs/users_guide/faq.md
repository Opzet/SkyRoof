# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q** I downloaded SkyRoof, and my virus scanner shows an infection. Is it real?

**A** Most likely, it is a false detection. However, it is always a good idea to test the dwonload link before downloading any software.
One of the online virus scanners that you can use for this is
[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url). Copy the download link and paste it on the virus scanner page. The scanner
will download the file, test it with multiple antivirus programs, and show you the results. In the screenshot below the download link
of SkyRoof 1.5 beta was tested, and all antivirus software, except one, agreed that the file was clean. When you see something like this,
you know that it was a false alarm.

**Q** The right part of the SkyRoof toolbar does not fit in the screen, even though the screen resoltuion is 1980x1280.

**A** This happens because your **text size** setting in Windows is too high. For example, if it is set to 200%, the effective
screen width is only `1900 / 2 = 950 pixels`. To fix this, right-click on the Desktop, click on **Display Settings** and set the text size
to a lower value.
