# Copilot Style Guidelines

- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use camelCase for variables and parameters
- Use PascalCase for all other identifiers
- do not put curly braces around a single statement if syntax rules allow
- place the statement that follows if(), while(), etc. on the same line if it fits
- start comment with a lower case letter unless it is all-capitals
- never remove any comments or blank lines
- ensure that no syntax errors are introduced by your formatting changes
